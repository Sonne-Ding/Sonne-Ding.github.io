  abstract={Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents a major risk factor of ischemic stroke recurrence with serious management implications. However, it often remains undiagnosed due to lack of standard or prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring. We aim to create a novel end-to-end artificial intelligence (AI) model that uses MRI data to rapidly identify high AF risk in patients who suffer from an acute ischemic stroke.},
